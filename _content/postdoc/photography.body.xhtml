        In early 2011, I decided to get a bit more serious about my hobby, photography.  I purchased
        my first DSLR (a <a target="_new" href="http://www.nikonusa.com/Nikon-Products/Product/Digital-SLR-Cameras/25472/D3100.html">Nikon D3100</a>);
        I am now on my third (a <a target="_new" href="http://www.nikonusa.com/Nikon-Products/Product/Digital-SLR-Cameras/25464/D300S.html">Nikon D300S</a>).  When I'm not working or
        commuting by bicycle, I'm often out exploring with my camera.

        Photography has always been a way for me to share my experiences with my family and friends.
        I may go places they don't want to go, or get up at times they don't want to be up,
        or be lying in filth that they don't want to lie down in,
        but I want them to see and feel what I see and feel.
