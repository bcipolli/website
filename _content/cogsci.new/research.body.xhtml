        <p>
          I've picked up a second year project with Gary Cottrell.  I've done a bit
          of work, but am still working on a proposal and even a committee!
          Wish me luck...

          I've created a <a href="/~bcipolli/blog/">second year project blog</a>
          to track my progress in choosing, creating, executing, and delivering
          my second year research project.

				<h1>Research Interests</h1>
				
        <p>
			  I am interested in using principles of natural computation, artificial life,
        and embodiment to develop models of knowledge and communication.

        <p>
        This necessarily involves interest in a huge number of fields, including
        <ul>
          <li>Animal cognition</li>
          <li>Evolution</li>
          <li>Language</li>
          <li>Machine learning</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
