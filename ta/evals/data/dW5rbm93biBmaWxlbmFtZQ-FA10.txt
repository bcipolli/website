Maybe spreading the time better next time would be good?	The wiki was very helpful to get our questions answered when we needed them. Thanks!

His sections are the reason why this class at least made some sense to me. I think he should teach the class, personally...	None. :)	He's AWESOME!!

He set aside some time to meet up with me outside of section and office hours on a weekly basis, and was always willing to help. He makes sure that you understand the material before moving on, and would often try numerous ways to describe a concept, trying to find the one that is most helpful to the student. Ben is also a funny and delightful person to be around, and always carries a smile on his face. 	No change.	I was really lucky to have Ben as a TA. Without him, I could not have done as well as I did in this class. It's not every quarter that one is lucky enough to have a TA like Ben. This course was by no means easy, but getting such a high caliber of help from Ben really made the struggle and difficult learning process all worthwhile.

She also didn't have a problem calling people out who were in the lab and not enrolled in the section, who talked to noisily. 	Speak louder.	Crane is great! She can be a little hard to understand sometimes because of how softly she speaks, but she engages the students which really helps you learn the material.
