Tell us that with an economic bailout, we believe there will be a downturn for about a year, then things will pick up.  Tell us what the long-term effects are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tell us about how universal health care will pan out.  Tell us the positives and negatives of your plan.

Seems like agreeing with policies is usually based on agreement in idealisms rather than truly feeling that we know how a policy is going to pan out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That doesn't have to be.  We put policies in place because we think we know how things are going to work out.  Not everything has to be immediately positive--especially if we are told to expect a short-term negative for a long-term positive result.

It's hard to take an idea that comes from a big question and to fit it under a much smaller question.  In this case, I'm actually taking my interest (timing issues in inter-hemispheric communication), finding an answerable question about it (how would the corpus callosum be used in a specific model of the brain), and then incoroporating that question into a research goal that is useful to a wider audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or at least, we'll see.

I've got a list, I've checked it twice, but I don't really want to get in touch with people until (a) I know what I want and (b) I know what they might want.  It's a lot of work--a lot of reading and thinking about me, then a lot of reading and thinking about their stuff.  If I was "smarter", it might go faster... but some of this is HARD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's my list:&lt;br /&gt;* Doug Nitz&lt;br /&gt;* Angela Yu&lt;br /&gt;* Jeff Elman&lt;br /&gt;* Virginia de Sa&lt;br /&gt;* Gary Cottrell&lt;br /&gt;* Terry Sejnowski&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also still need to do two lab rotations.  We are required to have 3 done by the end of this quarter.  I am thinking of doing one with one of the researchers above, then trying to do one with Marta next quarter related to developing measures of cross-hemisphere communication using EEG (either cross-hemisphere coherence like John Lewis, or something related to the SSVEP).   But I digress...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have our first proposal due on Monday (it's Friday).  At this point, I figure it's best for me to bust my ass to get this proposal done.  That will give me a lot of background information and direction.  It will also give me something concrete to forward to people I'm interested to have on my committee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I think I'll pretend like I'm an experimental test of the possibility that choosing your project BEFORE choosing a committee is the way to go.  If I can stay within deadlines for all things outside of the committee, maybe that will become a better way to go in the future.  If I think that way, at least, I can have some confidence, direction, and meaningful deadlines.  If I just focus on the fact that I don't have a committee in place, I'll feel like I'm late for everything, deadlines won't seem to have meaning, and I'll feel bad and do a bad job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, haircut-time.

First year is over, and it's time to get down to research.  The department thinks so, at least--we have a "second year project"--a research project that we must design, execute, and report on in order to move on in the program.  It is supposed to be the major focus of our second year in grad school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our first deadline was to select a committee for our project and came due over the summer.  Well, how to select a committee without selecting a general project area first?  As of yesterday, I am one month behind in getting this selection process done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's fun being officially behind.  Everybody feels anxiety like they are behind, because the workload in school is A BIT MUCH, but everybody else feels like they can't complain because, officially speaking, they're "on schedule".

It's been 3 years since I've been here, and I have been looking forward to meeting up with old friends.  Fortunately, there are two weeks off between the end of summer classes and the start of fall classes.  Even more fortunately, I could afford to buy a plane ticket and rent a car for the week.  And most fortunately, I had just the right number of friends to visit so that I could spend at least an evening with each person individually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The Bad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, the "unfortunates" are winning out: unfortunately, all my friends have real jobs and can't meet during the day.  Unfortunately, I pulled the details of this trip together at the last second and didn't create a strong schedule to really make solid plans.  And unfortunately, I don't have phone numbers and many of my friends aren't getting back to me via email!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The Ugly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I've been in classic "screw you!" mode, avoiding harping on what's NOT happening by staying focused on making other cool things happen.  So far--I hiked up the backside (no, not ass; backside!) of Mt. St. Helens and did some hiking at Mt. Ranier.  Also got 4 lbs of jerky at Stewart's Meat Market in Yelm (it's locally semi-famous! hot damn!).  The less I give away to friends, the more I'll take back with me.  Then again, this is the jerky that traumatized me... so maybe that's not for the best either.  So far, I'm dealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The ... Actual Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The REAL point of this post is to publish some photos from the trip.  I did the work to patch together panoramic photos this morning.  Here's a few to give a flavor of what I've been up to over the last few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The P.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only partly inspired by &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGUqd_M6Mg"&gt;Bill Pullman's "We will not go quietly into the night!" speech in Independence Day&lt;/a&gt;, I will continue to try and get in touch with my friends for dinner, lunch, or hiking.  I will say what I want, I will show disappointment if I don't get it, and that's OK! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The Photos&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4666021793121938641/6788343588918952642/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=4666021793121938641&amp;postID=6788343588918952642' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4666021793121938641/posts/default/6788343588918952642'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4666021793121938641/posts/default/6788343588918952642'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~bcipolli/blogs/grad/2008/09/no-rain-but-its-still-depressing.html' title='No Rain but it&apos;s Still Depressing'/><author><name>Ben</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16100825321235740658</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4666021793121938641.post-9100161615947627043</id><published>2008-07-29T16:26:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-09-28T19:09:49.166-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='fuck'/><title type='text'>The Groping Grad</title><content type='html'>I'm starting my second year in graduate school.  Many say that grad school is about narrowing your focus, doing research, ... and realizing how little you know, how little you will know, and how hard it is to even maintain the knowledge that you do have.  Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm in graduate school asking some questions about this life.  Most of them end in "fuck":&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;"Why the fuck?"&lt;/span&gt; - The classic question for graduate students.  We're a curious bunch; it can be used for exclamations about nature ("Why the fuck is every bit of the brain connected to every other bit??").  We're also a bunch of whiny bitches, and this gem can be used for classes and assignments ("Why the fuck do we have to read 120 pages of dry, technical journal papers for tomorrow's class?")&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;"How the fuck?"&lt;/span&gt; - Really popular in cognitive science, where we don't seem to know our asses from our heads.  "How the fuck does the brain create consciousness?" "How the fuck can he talk when he's got that giant hole in his brain?"   Also critical in getting any actual work done, as complaining is step #1 in the long process of doing any work whatsoever.  "How the fuck can I do a paper for this class, generate results from my research, and prepare this talk for tomorrow??"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;"Who the fuck?"&lt;/span&gt; - A severely underused question, "Who the fuck?" is useful for blaming ("Who the fuck forgot to clean the EEG cap?"), researching ("Who the fuck wrote that paper on the relationship between the BOLD response and LFPs?"), and, most critically, procrastinating and, critically, distracting others from your failure to get anything done ("Who the fuck was telling us about autism again?  Remember that talk, that ruled.")&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;"When the fuck?"&lt;/span&gt; - An extremely dangerous question, because the answer is either going to be "yesterday, and you blew it" or "a lot sooner than you can handle, buddy."  Best thing to do is to forget all dates as soon as possible.  "When the fuck is the symposium submission deadline?"  "When the fuck did you tell me to change the figure on this poster?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;"What the fuck?"&lt;/span&gt; - The mother of all "fuck" questions.  Grad school is hard, confusing, bewildering.  Ask questions of your advisor ("What the fuck do you want me to work on?"), your classmates ("What the fuck are we supposed to do?"), life itself ("What the fuck am I doing here?"), or to yourself ("WHAT THE FUCK?").  In a related note, this question can be reformulated into a exclamatory sentence, with a high reusability factor: for use when research doesn't work ("What THE FUCK!"), when you lock yourself out of your office while working late on Saturday night ("Oh, what the fuck!"), or with your hands and eyes raised to the sky when you just can't take it any more ("WHAT THE FUCK!!").&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Bottom line--graduate school is about groping around in the dark for answers.  Whether it be groping through endless virtual piles of electronic papers for data that might relate to your questions, groping through data you've collected for an actual result that you can report, or groping yourself because you just don't have the time, look, or recently cleansed body to attract a woman, be sure that you will be struggling, flailing, grasping, and groping every step of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fuck.
