        <h1>Fifth Year</h1>
        <p>
          My wisdom this year is that I cannot obtain all the knowledge and skills
          that I would like.  Rather than kill myself trying to get there all at once,
          I must balance between practical knowledge learned through research,
          new skills and techniques learned through classes, and 
          new literature and breadth of knowledge learned through many avenues.

          My FOURTH year: finally getting it!  One class per quarter to make things
          fun, do TAing when I need to ... and otherwise, DO SOME RESEARCH, SON!

        <h1>Third Year</h1>
        <p>
          My THIRD year is supposed to be basically devoid of classes.
          If that's so, then what the hell am I doing taking 3??

        <h1>Second Year</h1>
        <p>
          My second year is supposed to be less about study and more about research.
          Well, it's more about research... but still lots of courses to try and
          figure out HOW to do my research!

        <p>
          Although I'm a Ph.D student, the first year is certainly a LOT
          about coursework.  Here's some links to what I'm doing and what I've done.
