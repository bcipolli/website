              My name is Ben Cipollini.  I'm a 7th year (<a href="projects.php">whaaat?</a>) Ph.D candidate
              in the <a href="http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/">Cognitive Science Department</a>
              at <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              In <a href="research.php">my research</a>, I use computational modeling
              as a way to fuse data from behavioral psychology and neuroscience and
              test hypotheses about how the left and right sides of the brain differ (they do)
              and interact (they do).  I use those models to make predictions about the
              structure and function of the human brain.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have a <a href="projects.php">diverse set of interests</a> outside of academia,
                and my experiences in and out of graduate school have led me to
                create <a href="publications.php#talks">talks on a number of different topics</a>, including
                "what is human"?, about morality in science, among others.
