Yet a careful reading of the definition of "children's hospital" reveals that 80% of the money may go to &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; acute hospital so long as it treats children, among other patients. &lt;span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"&gt;It appears that a driving force behind this measure is to provide a backdoor way of compensating hospitals for treating indigents (including illegal aliens) who don't pay their way through the front door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(emphasis mine)&lt;/blockquote&gt;I am a strong believer that our current policy on illegal aliens is just about right.  The latest Bush stuff, erecting fences here and there, that's silliness.  I think we depend on having a certain number of illegal aliens in our country to do work that just about no american will do--seasonal, migratory work.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These people, and these systems, depend on having some amount of health care.  If that's funded by a back-asswards bill labeled "Children's Hospitals", then it fits right in with the rest of the "don't ask, don't tell" system we have in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vote YES on Prop 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8774236683873751668/2636783109823237584/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8774236683873751668&amp;postID=2636783109823237584' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8774236683873751668/posts/default/2636783109823237584'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8774236683873751668/posts/default/2636783109823237584'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~bcipolli/blogs/voting/2008/11/prop-3-is-interesting-to-me-for-one.html' title=''/><author><name>Ben</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16100825321235740658</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8774236683873751668.post-7179255191662832200</id><published>2008-11-01T13:34:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-11-01T13:44:22.671-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='YES on Prop 4'/><title type='text'>Prop 4: Waiting Period and Parentla Notification ...</title><content type='html'>Prop 4 boils down to this for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have defined "minor" and "parent/legal guardian" roles because we believe children, those under the age of 18, are not full PEOPLE yet, that they are not ready to make decisions on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now ask yourselves this: are the vast majority of girls under 18 ready to make the right decision as to whether or not it would be to their benefit to include their parents/legal guardian in a discussion about abortion?  That's a big decision, one that should be about more than just emotion and fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe some young adults are poised to make such a decision, but I don't think a vast majority are.  I believe it is right to define a difference between an adult and a minor.  I'm not sure 18 is the "right" date, but that's not what this prop is about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this prop is close enough to the right ideal that it's worth trying.

Although new spending is proposed, given the figures in the proposition, the state will come out ahead due to decreases expenses from prisons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. For all the "bad" possible side-effects of Prop 5, are they unique to Prop 5, or would they be true in some form or another for any large-scale rehabilitation program?  I think it is the latter, not the former.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. In that case, do we ever want to give large-scale rehabilitation a try?  If so, and if you're with me on (2), then I think it's time to vote for Prop 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It never seems like a good time for a large change.  Things are either too hard or too good.  You're either possibly disrupting during a time of destabilization, or disrupting during a time of wealth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It never seems like a good time for risk and unintended consequences.

Our vote will never be based in real understanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I wanted to see how different people were lining up with regards to Prop 6.  I saw that the District Attorney of San Diego FOR Prop 6, as is the sheriff of LA County.  I think San Diego and Los Angeles are two important regions where help is needed.  I'm not convinced that the opponents of Prop 6 live in urban areas of need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of throwing money at a problem.  I wish for rehabilitation over punishment.

To go without fire insurance in this region is just nutty. Having property owners pay the tax only makes sense--they're the ones who ultimately have the property and structures being protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I'm really against the current model of "fight small fires" and ultimately forcing unmanageable ones--by definition!--to burn. Ultimately we need controlled, frequent burns. Burns are natural, the carbon will be released either at a slow pace or at a delayed-then-fast one. Because of that, I'm reluctant to vote for a measure supporting this model for dealing with brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, any plan needs money, and I don't see that the controlled burns model is an option anywhere.

Many people take it as self-evident that money generated there should "stay" there.  I guess this comes from the same line of thought that says Obama's tax plan is socialist--those who earn money should keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that was the case, we wouldn't have any taxes nor government.  Individuals share resources to keep our entire country at a certain level of income and health--this winds up feeding back to the rich who may not need to worry in the short term.  The health of our nation protects the health of their investments, businesses, and ability to live safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, Prop C was put onto the ballot almost unanimously.  The two dissenters were basically saying that the reduced flexibility might come back to bite us in the ass.  True, but apparently we don't trust our elected officials and their appointees.  We feel safer telling them what to do with the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it's more likely for officials to misuse money than it is for us to have real trouble due to reduced flexibility.  We should also protect and keep up those areas that generate revenue for us.  25% of that excess revenue goes to other sources, and by using 75% of excess revenue to repair and expand Mission Bay, we're essentially protecting our valuable revenue source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I vote YES on Prop D</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8774236683873751668/8162669011544136075/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8774236683873751668&amp;postID=8162669011544136075' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8774236683873751668/posts/default/8162669011544136075'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8774236683873751668/posts/default/8162669011544136075'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~bcipolli/blogs/voting/2008/10/prop-c-use-of-mission-bay-excess-funds.html' title='Prop C: Use of Mission Bay Excess Funds'/><author><name>Ben</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16100825321235740658</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8774236683873751668.post-4362565680350579236</id><published>2008-10-18T19:20:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2008-10-18T19:30:20.307-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='california'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='prop d'/><title type='text'>Prop D: Alcohol Consumption on Beaches</title><content type='html'>This proposition seems entirely idealistic.
