He seemed honestly interested in the course material and our understanding of it. Even though I didn't really utilize his OH that much, it was cool that he had so many available. He really seemed invested in his students and in the course. I also liked that he left feedback on our homework assignments, which were really helpful. 	It was fun that he tried to think of ways to get the section involved, but sometimes they seemed to take time away from the material. 	I really appreciated the class forum and how much effort Ben put into responding promptly and just managing the site. Overall, I would be happy to have him for a TA any time!
