              My name is Ben Cipollini.  I'm a post-doc
              in the <a href="http://www.cse.ucsd.edu/">Computer Science &amp; Engineering Department</a>
              at <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego</a>.  I finished my Ph.D in
              <a href="http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/">Cognitive Science</a> in June 2014.

              In <a href="research.php">my Ph.D research</a>, I used computational modeling
              and data analysis to fuse data from behavioral psychology and neuroscience and
              test hypotheses about how the left and right sides of the brain differ (they do)
              and interact (they do).  I used the models to make predictions about the
              structure and function of the human brain.

                I have a <a href="projects.php">diverse set of interests</a> outside of academia,
                and my experiences in and out of graduate school have led me to
                create <a href="publications.php#talks">talks on a number of different topics</a>, including
                "what is human"?, about morality in science, among others.
