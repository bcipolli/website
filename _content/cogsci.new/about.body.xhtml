			  I've already got 5 websites about ME, and at least 3 others with content
        that I've developed.  Notice that this one probably has the cleanest design,
        SINCE I DIDN'T DESIGN IT!  What a relief :)

        <p>
        Anyway, here's a helpful hint on the type of content 
        contained in each site (linked on the right):
        <ul>
          <li>Pictures - <a href="http://ben.cipollini.name/">bencipollini.name</a> and <a href="http://bencip19.spaces.live.com/">MSN Live</a> sites</li>
          <li>Non-academic projects - <a href="http://ben.cipollini.name/">ben.cipollini.name</a></li>
        </ul>
        </p>
