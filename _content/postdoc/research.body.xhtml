        <h1>Current Research Projects</h1>

        <p>
          I am currently involved in three research projects
          with my advisor, <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/">Garrison Cottrell</a>.
          They are:
          <ul class="research-topics">
                <li><a name="aidx"></a>
                	<p>
                    	<b><u>Measuring lateralization</u></b> - 
                    Currently, lateralized function
                    in the brain is measured behaviorally, through brain damage, or through
                    visible differences in neuroimaging (ERP: different waveforms; fMRI: difference
                    in number or intensity of activated voxels)
                    </p>

                    <p>We are currently using multivariate approaches to see:
                	<ul>
                		<li>Relationships between different asymmetries in the brain. When
                		one part of the brain is asymmetric, are any others areas always
                		asymmetric too?</li>
                		<li>Representational similarity analysis (RSA) - forget whether
                		the two sides are active to the same level. Is the pattern of activations
                    	across all stimuli similar on the left and right sides, or are they
                    	computing different things?</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                        - We use a simple neural network modeling
                        technique (autoencoder PDP models) to
                        to relate long-range lateral connections within visual areas of the brain
                        to spatial frequency processing.  We then use this model to account
                        for differences in how the left and right sides of the brain
                        process visual information across numerous behavioral experiments.

                    	and not necessarily low frequency information,
                    	that differs between the hemispheres. We're modeling contrast balancing
                    	experiments--where contours are visible, but low frequencies are attenuated--to
                    	see if our model can account for these data that other models may not.

                        to show that effects of time delays, when predictable, are highly over-stated--they
                        can be overcome through predictive learning, one of the fundamental features of the brain.

                        <p>In this project, we argue that unreliable time delays cannot be overcome by
                        such means, suggest that unreliable delays exist early in mammalian development,
                        and argue that this effect is exacerbated more in humans than any other animal.

        <h1>Future Research Projects</h1>

        <p>
          I am currently applying for post-doctoral fellowships.  Proposed research projects include:
          <ul>
                <li><p>
                    <b><u>Computing the human corpus callosum</u></b> - The human corpus callosum is
                    composed of many tiny fibers that are hard to view; they quickly disintegrate after death,
                    and require an electron microscope to see.  However, the prevalence of these fibers
                    affects not only how we think, but how researchers interpret people's brain scans, particularly
                    structural scans that tell us about the brain's long-distance connections (DTI).

                    <p>In this project, I plan to use animal data (electron microscope, with small fibers) and
                    human data (light microscope) to estimate the true numbers of fibers in the human corpus callosum
                    across the lifespan.  I then hope to use this information to help interpret human
                    structural brain scans (DTI).

                        <b><u>Interhemispheric connectivity across species</u></b> (unpublished) - It has been argued that the hemispheres
                        are asymmetric particularly in humans because our hemispheres are more independent than in other
                        mammals.  We hypothesize that the opposite must be true - in order for the two sides to do
                        different things, they <i>must</i> be able to talk with each other.
                        </p>

                        <p>In this project, we show that a previous reports of decreased connectivity between the hemispheres
                        in large-brained animals were based on incorrect assumptions.  Using more data from the literature,
                        we show that interhemispheric connections are as important, and probably
                        more important, than the average connection between two parts of the brain.
