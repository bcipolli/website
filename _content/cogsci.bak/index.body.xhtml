				<h1>New Website</h1>
				
        <p>
			  I just pulled a new website format from <a href="http://www.styleshout.com/">styleshout.com</a>, 
        pulled to pieces and templatized it using <a href="http://www.smarty.net/">Smarty</a>,
        and started posting some content.  Hopefully I set things up to I can move
        to different styles from styleshout every so often...

        See the "About" section for the previous website here, as well as other websites
        with content about ME.  There are at least 6 now!
