Yet a careful reading of the definition of "children's hospital" reveals that 80% of the money may go to &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; acute hospital so long as it treats children, among other patients. &lt;span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"&gt;It appears that a driving force behind this measure is to provide a backdoor way of compensating hospitals for treating indigents (including illegal aliens) who don't pay their way through the front door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(emphasis mine)&lt;/blockquote&gt;I am a strong believer that our current policy on illegal aliens is just about right.  The latest Bush stuff, erecting fences here and there, that's silliness.  I think we depend on having a certain number of illegal aliens in our country to do work that just about no american will do--seasonal, migratory work.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These people, and these systems, depend on having some amount of health care.  If that's funded by a back-asswards bill labeled "Children's Hospitals", then it fits right in with the rest of the "don't ask, don't tell" system we have in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vote YES on Prop 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~bcipolli/blogs/voting/2008/11/prop-3-is-interesting-to-me-for-one.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Ben)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8774236683873751668.post-7179255191662832200</guid><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2008 20:34:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-11-01T13:44:22.671-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>YES on Prop 4</category><title>Prop 4: Waiting Period and Parentla Notification ...</title><description>Prop 4 boils down to this for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have defined "minor" and "parent/legal guardian" roles because we believe children, those under the age of 18, are not full PEOPLE yet, that they are not ready to make decisions on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now ask yourselves this: are the vast majority of girls under 18 ready to make the right decision as to whether or not it would be to their benefit to include their parents/legal guardian in a discussion about abortion?  That's a big decision, one that should be about more than just emotion and fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe some young adults are poised to make such a decision, but I don't think a vast majority are.  I believe it is right to define a difference between an adult and a minor.

Although new spending is proposed, given the figures in the proposition, the state will come out ahead due to decreases expenses from prisons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. For all the "bad" possible side-effects of Prop 5, are they unique to Prop 5, or would they be true in some form or another for any large-scale rehabilitation program?  I think it is the latter, not the former.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. In that case, do we ever want to give large-scale rehabilitation a try?  If so, and if you're with me on (2), then I think it's time to vote for Prop 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It never seems like a good time for a large change.  Things are either too hard or too good.

It creates a new commission, some bureaucracy for executing the redistricting, and a whole lotta headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, Prop 11:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Costs more&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is more confusing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doesn't seem to guarantee any improvment over existing methods.

To go without fire insurance in this region is just nutty.

Ultimately we need controlled, frequent burns. Burns are natural, the carbon will be released either at a slow pace or at a delayed-then-fast one. Because of that, I'm reluctant to vote for a measure supporting this model for dealing with brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, any plan needs money, and I don't see that the controlled burns model is an option anywhere.

The amount of money being allocated for spending is basically not spending.  However, the use of the funds is changing drastically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly 75% of the excess funds generated by Mission Bay will be required to be spent on Mission Bay improvements.  Many people take it as self-evident that money generated there should "stay" there.  I guess this comes from the same line of thought that says Obama's tax plan is socialist--those who earn money should keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that was the case, we wouldn't have any taxes nor government.  Individuals share resources to keep our entire country at a certain level of income and health--this winds up feeding back to the rich who may not need to worry in the short term.  The health of our nation protects the health of their investments, businesses, and ability to live safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, Prop C was put onto the ballot almost unanimously.  The two dissenters were basically saying that the reduced flexibility might come back to bite us in the ass.  True, but apparently we don't trust our elected officials and their appointees.  We feel safer telling them what to do with the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it's more likely for officials to misuse money than it is for us to have real trouble due to reduced flexibility.  We should also protect and keep up those areas that generate revenue for us.  25% of that excess revenue goes to other sources, and by using 75% of excess revenue to repair and expand Mission Bay, we're essentially protecting our valuable revenue source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I vote YES on Prop D</description><link>http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~bcipolli/blogs/voting/2008/10/prop-c-use-of-mission-bay-excess-funds.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Ben)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8774236683873751668.post-4362565680350579236</guid><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2008 02:20:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-10-18T19:30:20.307-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>california</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>prop d</category><title>Prop D: Alcohol Consumption on Beaches</title><description>This proposition seems entirely idealistic.

On the other hand, democracy demands education and exercise of self-control, and neither of those things are happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If democracy was really about choice, we wouldn't have a drinking age, nor would we outlaw drugs or do a million of the other big-brother things that we do.  So, I don't believe in the ideal.  Arguing ideals is vacuous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, what we argue is ... is alcoholic consumption bringing down the quality of our beaches?  Would our beaches be better off without alcohol consumption?  I'd say that, without a clear answer, we should allow things.  Unless they're clearly problematic, we have no reason to impose laws and force ourselves to try and enforce them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven't heard of any good argument on why our beaches would be better off without alcohol.  I can see some small pluses (maybe safer, less rowdy crowd?), but also minuses (fewer people, less lively, less hot-spotty). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't see any good arguments at &lt;a href="http://www.sddemocrats.org/2008_Endorsements.pdf"&gt;smartvoter.org&lt;/a&gt; either (just found the site; awesome!), so I vote NO.</description><link>http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~bcipolli/blogs/voting/2008/10/prop-d-alcohol-consumption-on-beaches.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Ben)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8774236683873751668.post-906364868252663699</guid><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2008 21:13:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-10-18T19:35:14.988-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>san diego</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>california</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>prop s</category><title>Prop S: Funding for schools</title><description>The &lt;a href="http://www.sddemocrats.org/2008_Endorsements.pdf"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; says YES on S; &lt;a href="http://www.sandiegorepublicans.org/voterguide/"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; say NO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES seems easy: $2 billion for education (although Wifi in every classroom seems completely unnecessary), no tax increase (just an extension of an existing tax program).  See &lt;a href="http://www.edforchildren.com/img/home/invite_oct15.pdf"&gt;http://www.edforchildren.com/img/home/invite_oct15.pdf&lt;/a&gt; for a slightly more in depth view on YES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO is harder to find arguments for.  In fact, I just emailed &lt;a href="mailto:comments@sandiegorepublicans.org"&gt;comments@sandiegorepublicans.org&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm trying to figure out my position on Prop S for the upcoming election and can't find any arguments for saying NO on Prop S.  I see that the Republican Party's official endorsement on "S" is "NO".  Is there somewhere I could see the reasoning behind that position so that I can make an educated decision myself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Ben Cipollini&lt;/blockquote&gt;We'll see what that turns up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, now that I've found &lt;a href="http://www.smartvoter.org/"&gt;SmartVoter.org&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www.smartvoter.org/2008/11/04/ca/sd/prop/S/"&gt; I've got everything I need&lt;/a&gt;.  The "NO" argument is weak--even if they're right that $100 million is being diverted, that's only 5% of the need that they specify.  Tiny!  Their rebuttal is weak, their argument is weak, THEY ARE WEAK!  AND, I'm not going to be a homeowner anytime soon, so this is great for ME! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;YES ON PROP S!!&lt;/span&gt;</description><link>http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~bcipolli/blogs/voting/2008/10/prop-s-funding-for-schools.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Ben)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8774236683873751668.post-938886967577161425</guid><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2008 20:33:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-10-18T13:37:01.165-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>california</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>voting</category><title>Mission Statement</title><description>I've got my absentee ballot in front of me.  On 90% of the things I can vote on, I have no information other than the 3 sentence blurb on the ballot itself.  How many people like myself vote based on these blurbs?  Where do the blurbs come from?  Is this really democracy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I submit that it's not democracy unless each voter is educated.  The whole "vote!" movement has it backwards--the first step is to get EDUCATED on what's happening.  If after being educated you're not motivated to vote, then I will wish that I'd be living your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each post in this blog will find bipartisan information on a single voting issue on the ballot.  I'll be rockin' and rollin' through them, posting up links, thoughts, then a reasoned final decision, until I finish each and every entry in my California ballot.</description><link>http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~bcipolli/blogs/voting/2008/10/mission-statement.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Ben)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item></channel></rss>
