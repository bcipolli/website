				<h1>Splitting Me Up Four Ways</h1>
				
        <p>
			  My time gets split pretty unevenly amongst teaching, study, research, and ...
        my small business.  This small business is what gets me through grad school
        and gives me hope of actually maybe having a home and family and ... retirement! 
        some day.
